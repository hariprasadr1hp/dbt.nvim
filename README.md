# dbt.nvim

A Neovim plugin to work with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).
It lets you navigate and manage DBT models like code â€” with full support for model dependencies, compiled SQL, and schema files.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Jump between:
  - `model.sql` â‡„ `compiled.sql` â‡„ `run.sql`
  - `model.sql` â‡„ `schema.yml`
- Cycle through file types with `[v` / `]v` (model / schema / compile and run target)
- Explore upstream/downstream dependencies with `:DBTUpstream` and `:DBTDownstream`
- `:DBTDiff` â€“ see a diff between the model and its compiled output
- Toggle file cycling with `:DBTToggleCyclingFiles`

---

## âš™ Requirements

- `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` and `DBT_PROJECT_NAME` must be set as environment variables
- Works with DBT's `manifest.json` (produced by `dbt compile`, `dbt run`, etc., at `target/`)
- make sure that the naming convention for the model and its corresponding schema file remain consistent
