# dbt.nvim

A Neovim plugin to work with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).
It lets you navigate and manage DBT models like code â€” with full support for model dependencies, compiled SQL, and schema files.

## âœ¨ Features

- Jump between:
  - `model.sql` â‡„ `compiled.sql` â‡„ `run.sql`
  - `model.sql` â‡„ `schema.yml`
- Cycle through file types with `[v` / `]v`
- Explore upstream/downstream dependencies with `:DBTUpstream` and `:DBTDownstream`
- `:DBTDiff` â€“ see a diff between the model and its compiled output
- Toggle file cycling with `:DBTToggleCyclingFiles`

## âš™ Requirements

- [`fzf-lua`](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua)
